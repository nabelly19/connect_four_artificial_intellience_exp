Connect Four (or Four in a Line) is a two-player game with perfect information ðŸ’¡

## What is this game?

A two-player game with perfect information â€”_meaning no aspect of the game state is hidden_. It is also a zero-sum adversarial game, where one player's advantage exactly matches the opponent's disadvantage.

The board consists of 6 rows and 7 columns, and there are approximately **4.5 trillion** possible positions in this game.

The rules are simple: players choose a color and take turns placing tokens on a vertical note. Each token lands on the lowest free position in the chosen column.

The objective is to form the first line of _four_ consecutive tokens of the same color (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
